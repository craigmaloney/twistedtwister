Your Game Title

Entry in PyWeek #5  <http://www.pyweek.org/5/>
Team: Monkey Typer 
Members: craigm

You are Sammy the Spotter, out to test your latest invention: the Tornado
Obliterator and Eradicator 3000 (TOE 3000). Using your spotter experience, you
drive out, keeping tuned to the Baker Weather Service (the best weather service
on the planet). Suddenly, you hear over the radio: "Tornadoes approaching!"
Perfect! This is the chance to see if the TOE 3000 will really work! You rush
on out, careful to stay in your car. This is it! Oh NO! There are houses here.
Maybe you can help them! Can you eradicate the tornadoes, save the houses, and
keep away from the lightning storm?

DEPENDENCIES:

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/
  PyGame:     http://www.pygame.org/



RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py



HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Move the arrow keys left and right to navigate Sammy the Spotter. Use the
Control key to fire the TOE 3000. The tornadoes can't harm Sammy Spotter
(they're too far away) but they will remove the houses from the area. If Sammy
loses all of the houses, the game is over. Also, Sammy's car and equipment are
highly susceptible to lightning. If a lightning bolt hits Sammy's car, it will
shoot sparks, and stop working until Sammy can fix it.
